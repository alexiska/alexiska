### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page

### Some of my recent projects:
*    [Cluster analysis of Fifa 2020 data set] (https://github.com/alexiska/Cluster-analysis-of-fifa-2020-data-set)
     In this exercise soccer players skills will be used to determine their positions by using a machine learning technique called K-means clustering which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm tries to find relationships between the observations which have similair pattern and try to cluster them together. The provided data set do have player's positions but will not include them during clustering, otherwise this exercise is meaningless. The player's position data will be compared later after the cluster analysis to se how the analysis performed.
